# The Divine Order: The Interconnection of Knowledge, Science, Faith, and the Determination of Every Property

## Introduction  
Human nature compels us to marvel at new phenomena. Initially, discoveries such as flight, space travel, or even mobile technology evoke wonder. However, as these innovations become commonplace, their underlying marvels are often taken for granted. The Holy Quran reminds us that every creation—from the smallest particle to the vast expanse of the oceans—operates under a divinely ordained order, a precise set of properties fixed by Allah’s decree.

## The Relationship between Knowledge, Science, and Faith  
History shows that when scientific breakthroughs occur, people are first amazed by what they see. Consider the following examples:
- **Airplanes:** Once seen as miraculous contraptions, they are now an everyday mode of travel.
- **Space Travel:** What was once confined to the realm of fantasy is now a tangible reality.
- **Mobile Technology and the Internet:** Initially, these innovations were causes for awe, but today they are integrated into daily life.

Allah addresses this human tendency in the Quran:

> **"And if We were to send down a piece of the sky upon them, they would say, 'It is just like a rain cloud that is falling upon us.'"**  
> *(Surah At-Tur: 44)*

This verse illustrates that as familiarity grows, the initial wonder fades—even though the underlying order and miraculous nature of creation remain intact. True faith takes root in hearts that continue to reflect on and appreciate the divine design behind every phenomenon.

## Determination of Every Property in Creation  
The term **“property”** refers to the unique attributes or characteristics inherent in every creation—attributes that Allah has decreed and fixed. This divine determination can be observed at multiple levels:

### 1. Atomic Structure and Elemental Properties  
- **Atomic Number and Element Alignment:**  
  Every element has an atomic number that represents the number of protons in its nucleus. For instance, hydrogen has 1 proton, oxygen has 8, and carbon has 6.  
- **Arrangement of Subatomic Particles:**  
  Within each atom, protons, neutrons, and electrons are arranged in a specific order. This arrangement defines the element's identity and its chemical behavior.  
- **Divine Decree:**  
  These immutable properties are part of the divine order. As stated in the Quran:  
  > **"And We have created all things with exact determination."**  
  > *(Surah Al-Qamar: 49)*

### 2. Molecular Structure and Physical Properties  
- **Molecular Structure:**  
  The structure of a molecule is determined by the specific combination and arrangement of atoms. For example, water (H₂O) is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom arranged in a definite manner. A slight alteration in this arrangement changes the very identity of the molecule.  
- **Physical Properties such as Density:**  
  Attributes like density, solubility, and melting point are intrinsic properties derived from a molecule’s composition and the nature of the bonds between atoms.  
- **Divine Order:**  
  These properties, too, are fixed by Allah’s command—underscoring the idea that every aspect of creation is precisely determined.

## The Case of Two Seas: A Divine Property  
One of the remarkable signs mentioned in the Quran is the barrier between two distinct bodies of water:

> **"It is He who has released two seas meeting together; between them is a barrier which they do not transgress."**  
> *(Surah Ar-Rahman: 19-20)*

Modern science has confirmed that when two bodies of water meet, differences in salinity, temperature, and density create an invisible barrier. This phenomenon is not merely a physical separation but a manifestation of a specific property—one that Allah has set into the natural order. Just as the atomic and molecular properties are divinely ordained, the separation of these waters exemplifies the intricate and precise order governing all creation.

## Conclusion  
The study of science and the pursuit of knowledge reveal the underlying divine order that governs every aspect of creation. Whether it is the atomic structure of elements, the molecular composition of substances, or the barrier between two seas, each property is meticulously determined by Allah’s decree. These immutable characteristics are a testament to His supreme wisdom and power.

By reflecting on these signs, one realizes that science is not an independent force creating new phenomena but rather a means of uncovering the divine system that has always been in place. Ultimately, true faith flourishes in those who appreciate and understand this intricate balance, acknowledging that every aspect of the universe—no matter how minute—is under the divine control of Allah.
